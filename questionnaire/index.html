    <ol>
        <li>Describe your previous experiences with coding. What classes have you already taken where you were exposed
            to HTML/CSS/JS? What parts of the class resonated with you? What parts were most confusing?</li>
        Last semster was my first time ever coding. It was a little tedious to get the hang of at first, but by
        the end of the semester I truly felt like I had learned something new. The only things that remained
        tricky for me is javascript, as we didn't touch on that very much last semester.</p>
        <li>How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in
            this class to help reduce this anxiety?</li>
        <p>I'm very excited to learn coding because I've always enjoyed website designing. I was more nervous last
            semester, but since I have a little knowledge about code I'm able to absorb what I learn better in
            this class. </p>
        <li>How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</li>
        <p> I imagine coding will come in handy many times, as I hope to continue in the web design path.</p>
        <li>What text editor do you prefer to use?</li>
        <p>For school I like to use Stickies</p>
        <li>Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.</li>
        <p>We used Github last semester. I know that it's used to publish our websites, but that's about it.</p>
        <li>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this
            relationship. Bonus points for creative analogies.</li>
        <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript is like salt, pepper and ketchup. They all taste different, but serve the
            same purpose of editing a website.</p>
        <li>Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there are six levels
            of heading tags, `h1` through `h6`).</li>
        <h1>1. Pasta</h1>
        <h2>2. Broccoli cheddar soup</h2>
        <h3>3. Chinese food</h3>
        <h4>4. Falafel</h4>
        <h5>5. Almond-crusted flounder</h5>
        <h6>6. Margherita pizza</h6>
        <li>Create an unordered list ( `ul` ) and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related
            websites. Include a paragraph ( `p` ) on each site describing why it is important to you.</li>
        <ul>Pinterest
            <p>I always use pinterest for inspiration because it curates all the post towards my interests.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>Instagram
            <p>Another platform that brings me inspiration for graphic design is instagram. I'm always introduced to new
                indeas using
                the explore page.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <li>Insert an image (`img`) that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes `alt text` that
            describes the image.</li>
        <img src="/media/images/paisley.jpeg">
        <alt text>My dog Paisley</alt>
        <li>Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).
            You have a few ways you can approach this:
            <ul>
                <li>Look into the `iframe` tag. Hint: If using a YouTube or Vimeo video, you can copy the embed code
                    from
                    each video’s page.</li>
                <li>Use a `video` tag, though finding the URL of a video can sometimes be tricky – do you best to
                    download,
                    place it in your project folder, then reference its file path</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <video width="500" height="240" controls>
            <source src="media/videos/IMG_7526.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <li>Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to
            maintain proper indentation.
            <ul>
                <li>`main` → `section` → `div` → `p` → `span`</li>
                <li>No need to fill these tags with any actual content</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <main>
            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <span></span>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
        </main>
        <li>Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another
            ordered list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make
            sure
            you nest your ordered lists properly.</li>
        <ul>1. Australia
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Use `pre` tags to create a simple [concrete poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry) version
            of a Haiku or other poem you write. The poem should represent how you feel at this moment.
            <ul>
                <li>Hint: `pre` tags respect whitespace, you can add add lots of spaces and line breaks and they will
                    show
                    up like that when you view the web page.</li>
